## Challenge #3

We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get
back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.
Example Inputs
object = {"a":{"b":{"c":"d"}}}
key = a/b/c
object = {"x":{"y":{"z":"a"}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a

## Solution

1. Edit the ```sample.json``` and add the object/Dict and save it.
2. Run the application ``` app.py ``.
3. Input the key seperated with /.
4. Get output.
